Database Quest 
------------
Introduction
-
I completed the Database Quest through SimuLearn, and this experience helped me understand how databases are designed, managed, and used in cloud environments. The quest provided hands-on practice that strengthened my theoretical knowledge, and earning the certificate made the learning process more rewarding and meaningful.

What I Learned
-
During the Database Quest, I learned key database concepts, including:

The fundamentals of databases and data storage

Differences between relational and non-relational databases

Basic database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data

Understanding tables, records, and queries

The importance of data consistency, availability, and security

How cloud databases support scalability and performance

These lessons helped me understand how data is efficiently stored and managed in modern applications.

How It Helped Me Understand What I Studied
-
Before completing the Database Quest, many database concepts were theoretical. SimuLearn helped me:

Apply database concepts in real-world simulations

Understand how queries retrieve and manipulate data

See how cloud databases differ from traditional databases

Learn why proper database design is important
