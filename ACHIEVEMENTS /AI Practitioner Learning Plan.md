In this course, I studied practical aspects of working with AI and generative AI technologies. I learned how to design, build, and deploy AI applications, including understanding foundation models, prompt engineering, and real-world use cases. The course also covered best practices for security, governance, and optimizing AI solutions, giving me hands-on skills to implement AI effectively in professional projects.
