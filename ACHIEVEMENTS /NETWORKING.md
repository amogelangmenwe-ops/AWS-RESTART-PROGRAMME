Networking Cloud Quest 
------------------------------
Introduction
--
Participating in the Networking Cloud Quest was a valuable learning experience for me. It helped me connect the theory I studied in networking with real hands-on cloud practice. Instead of just reading concepts, I was able to apply them in real scenarios, which made everything clearer and more meaningful.

What I Learned
-
Through the Networking Cloud Quest, I learned several important networking concepts, including:

How virtual networks (VPCs) work in a cloud environment

The role of subnets, IP addressing, and routing

How firewalls and security rules control traffic

How cloud resources communicate with each other securely

Basic troubleshooting of network connectivity issues

This quest helped me understand how networking works beyond traditional on-premise setups and how cloud platforms manage networking at scale.

How It Helped Me Understand What I Studied
--

Before this quest, I studied networking mostly through theory, such as IP addresses, routing, and security rules. However, some concepts felt abstract.

The Cloud Quest helped me:
-
Visualize how networks are created and connected

Understand why certain configurations are required

See how mistakes in networking settings can break communication

Gain confidence by actually setting things up myself

Doing the labs made the topics I studied feel real and practical, not just textbook knowledge.

Challenges I Faced
-
While completing the Networking Cloud Quest, I faced several challenges:

Understanding network configurations – At first, it was confusing to know which settings were required and why.

Firewall rules issues – Sometimes my resources couldn’t communicate because a rule was missing or misconfigured.

Troubleshooting errors – When something didn’t work, it was difficult to immediately identify the problem.

Time management – Some labs took longer than expected, especially when I had to retry steps.

Solutions and How I Overcame Them
-
To overcome these challenges, I:

Carefully read the instructions step by step

Referred back to networking fundamentals I had studied

Used trial and error to understand how different settings affect connectivity

Paid attention to error messages instead of ignoring them

Repeated labs when necessary to fully understand the process

These solutions helped me improve not only my technical skills but also my problem-solving and patience.

Conclusion

Overall, the Networking Cloud Quest was a very helpful and rewarding experience. It strengthened my understanding of cloud networking and showed me how theory is applied in real-world cloud environments. Despite the challenges, completing the quest improved my confidence and prepared me better for future cloud and networking projects.
