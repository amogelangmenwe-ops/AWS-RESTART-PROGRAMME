Taste of Africa – Static Restaurant Website and AWS Migration Project
Praesignis AWS re/Start Special Projects

Project 1: Building a Static Website for a Restaurant and Presenting AWS Migration Benefits
-

Project Overview
-

Taste of Africa is a well-known local restaurant that celebrates African culture through food, atmosphere, and hospitality. The restaurant offers a variety of traditional African dishes and has built a loyal customer base over time. As the restaurant became more popular, the number of customers making bookings and placing orders increased significantly.

Before this project, Taste of Africa relied mainly on manual methods such as phone calls, WhatsApp messages, emails, and handwritten notes to manage reservations and food orders. While this approach worked initially, it quickly became inefficient as customer demand grew. Bookings were sometimes double-booked, orders were mixed up, and staff spent a lot of time trying to confirm information with customers.

The goal of this project was to create a simple but effective static website hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The website allows customers to interact with the restaurant online by viewing information, submitting bookings, and placing orders. In addition, the project demonstrates how moving the restaurant’s digital presence to AWS can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and support future growth.

                                               Project Objectives

The main objective of this project was to design and develop a user-friendly static website for Taste of Africa that improves how the restaurant communicates with its customers. The website was created to make it easier for customers to find information, place orders, and request bookings without relying on phone calls or manual processes.

Another key objective was to host the website on AWS using cloud services, specifically Amazon S3. By doing so, the project highlights the benefits of cloud migration, including scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. The project also aimed to prepare a clear presentation explaining the business value of AWS to non-technical stakeholders, such as the restaurant owner.

                                            Website Features and Functionality

The Taste of Africa website was designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. The home page introduces the restaurant and gives visitors a welcoming first impression. It provides an overview of the restaurant’s identity, values, and the type of cuisine offered.

The website includes an “About” page that tells the story of Taste of Africa and highlights its cultural roots. The menu page displays a selection of African dishes, supported by images that make the food visually appealing and help customers decide what to order.

To address the restaurant’s operational challenges, the website includes a booking form where customers can request table reservations and an order submission form for food orders. After submitting a form, customers are directed to a confirmation page, which reassures them that their request has been received. The website uses minimal colours to ensure readability while still incorporating images to enhance the overall design and user experience.

All images used on the website are hosted on Amazon S3, ensuring they load quickly and remain accessible at all times.

                                             AWS Services Used in the Project

Amazon S3 was used as the primary AWS service for this project. It hosts the static website and stores all related content, including images of food and the restaurant environment. Amazon S3 was chosen because it is highly reliable, secure, and cost-effective, especially for static websites.

By using AWS, the restaurant no longer needs to worry about maintaining physical servers or managing complex infrastructure. The cloud-based approach ensures that the website remains available to customers at all times, even during busy periods.

                                      Restaurant Challenges Before Moving to the Cloud

Before implementing the website and AWS solution, Taste of Africa faced several challenges. The manual booking and order system often resulted in mistakes, such as incorrect orders or overlapping reservations. Staff had to spend extra time resolving these issues, which affected customer satisfaction.

There was no centralised system to store customer information, making it difficult to identify repeat customers or manage special requests. As the restaurant continued to grow, scaling the existing system would have required hiring additional staff or investing in expensive on-premises technology.

                                          Solutions Provided Through This Project

The introduction of an online booking and order system helped reduce errors and improved overall efficiency. Customers can now submit their requests online, which creates a clear and organised way for the restaurant to receive and manage information.

Hosting the website on AWS ensures high availability and reliability, allowing customers to access the website at any time. The confirmation page improves the customer experience by providing immediate feedback, while the digital system reduces the workload on staff and minimises confusion.

                                      Team Collaboration and Working Approach

This project was completed as a team effort, with each member contributing their skills and knowledge. Tasks were shared among team members, including website design, content creation, AWS configuration, research, and presentation development.

Regular team discussions played a key role in the success of the project. These meetings allowed us to share progress, address challenges, and support one another. By working collaboratively, we were able to combine our strengths and deliver a complete and well-structured solution.

                                         Challenges Faced and How We Overcame Them

One of the main challenges we faced was the difference in technical skill levels within the team. Not all members had prior experience with HTML, CSS, or AWS services. To overcome this, we practiced peer learning, where more experienced team members guided others and shared helpful resources.

Another challenge involved configuring Amazon S3 correctly, particularly setting permissions and ensuring the website was publicly accessible. Through careful research, testing, and teamwork, we were able to resolve these issues and successfully deploy the website.

Managing time and coordinating tasks was also challenging. We addressed this by clearly dividing responsibilities, maintaining open communication, and supporting each other when deadlines approached.

                                               Key Benefits of AWS for Taste of Africa

Migrating to AWS offers several benefits for Taste of Africa. The website is highly available and reliable, ensuring customers can access it whenever they need to. AWS provides a cost-effective solution that eliminates the need for expensive hardware and ongoing maintenance.

The cloud infrastructure allows the restaurant to scale easily as customer demand grows. Overall, AWS helps improve customer satisfaction, reduces operational errors, and provides a secure platform for the restaurant’s digital presence.

                                                  Presentation Summary

As part of this project, a PowerPoint presentation was created to explain the solution and its benefits. The presentation includes an overview of the restaurant, the challenges it faced, the proposed AWS solution, and the advantages of cloud migration. Screenshots of the website and examples of AWS services are included to make the presentation engaging and easy to understand.

                                                    Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a simple static website hosted on AWS can make a significant difference for a small business. By moving to the cloud, Taste of Africa is able to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance the customer experience. The solution provides a strong foundation for future growth and digital transformation.
