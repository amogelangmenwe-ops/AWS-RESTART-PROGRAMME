⚙️ Amazon EC2 Project
Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy and manage a virtual server using Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud). EC2 allows you to launch scalable, customizable virtual machines in the cloud, giving you full control over the operating system, software, security, and performance settings.

What This Project Covers

Launching an EC2 instance

Connecting via SSH or EC2 Instance Connect

Installing and configuring software (e.g., web server, app runtime)

Setting up security groups and inbound/outbound rules

Managing key pairs for secure access

Configuring instance storage and monitoring performance

Optional: Setting up a load balancer or auto scaling

Why EC2 Is Important

Amazon EC2 gives you flexible computing power without buying physical servers. It’s ideal for hosting websites, running applications, processing workloads, and creating development or testing environments. You can scale resources up or down as needed, only paying for what you use.
