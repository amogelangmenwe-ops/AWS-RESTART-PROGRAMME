----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this lab, I explored the Bash shell, which is the command-line interface for interacting with a Linux system. The main goal was to understand how to use Bash commands, navigate the file system, manage files and directories, and execute scripts. This lab provided hands-on experience with essential Linux commands, shell features, and basic scripting, helping me become more comfortable working in a command-line environment.

✔ Project Objectives

Understand how to use the Bash shell to interact with Linux.

Navigate the file system using commands like cd, ls, and pwd.

Manage files and directories using commands such as cp, mv, rm, and mkdir.

Learn how to view, create, and edit files with commands like cat, nano, and touch.

Understand the basics of executing shell scripts and using command-line arguments.

Learn how to combine commands and use pipes and redirection to perform complex tasks.

✔ What I Did

Navigated directories using cd and listed contents with ls.

Viewed the current directory path using pwd.

Created, copied, moved, and deleted files and directories using touch, cp, mv, rm, and mkdir.

Viewed and edited file contents using cat and nano.

Practiced using input/output redirection (>, >>, <) and pipes (|) to combine commands.

Learned to execute simple Bash scripts and pass arguments to them.

Explored built-in Bash commands and shortcuts to improve efficiency while working in the shell.

Difficulties Encountered

Remembering command syntax: Some commands had multiple options and flags that were easy to forget.
Understanding redirection and pipes: Combining commands using > or | was confusing at first.
File permissions: Running scripts sometimes failed due to lack of execute permissions, which required troubleshooting with chmod.
Navigating directories quickly: Managing paths and relative vs. absolute references was tricky initially.
Error messages: Mis-typed commands or wrong paths produced errors that needed careful reading to fix
