                        LAB 245  Managing Long Files

In this lab, I explored how Linux systems generate, store, and manage log files. The main goal was to understand where logs are located, how to read them, and how automated log rotation helps keep the system organized and efficient. I worked with tools like cat, less, tail, and journalctl to view different types of logs and monitor system activity. I also examined how logrotate controls the size, rotation schedule, and archival process of log files. ThLis lab helped me understand the importance of logs for troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and maintaining the overall health of a Linux system.

✔ Project Objectives

Understand where system and application logs are stored and how to access them.

Use Linux commands to view and monitor log files efficiently.

Learn how log rotation works with logrotate to manage file size, retention, and archiving.

Understand the role of logs in troubleshooting, system performance tracking, and security auditing.

✔ What I Did

Explored the /var/log directory to see where different types of logs are stored.

Used cat, less, and tail to view log files and monitor system activity.

Practiced using journalctl to filter and analyze systemd-managed logs.

Reviewed logrotate configuration files to understand how logs are rotated, compressed, and archived.

Checked older rotated log files to see how long-term log storage works.

Observed how proper log management supports troubleshooting and overall system health.

Difficulties Encountered

Understanding log types and locations: At first, it was a bit confusing to know which logs were in /var/log and which were managed by journalctl.

Reading long log files: Some logs were very large, which made it tricky to find specific entries.

Interpreting log entries: Certain messages, especially errors, were technical and not immediately clear.

Understanding logrotate configuration: Figuring out how rotation schedules, retention policies, and compression worked required careful reading.

Permissions issues: Some logs needed elevated permissions to access, so I had to troubleshoot access errors.
