🖥️ AWS CLI

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with AWS services directly from your terminal. Instead of clicking around in the AWS Console, the CLI lets you run commands to create resources, upload files, configure services, and automate tasks. It’s especially useful for scripting, managing multiple environments, and performing repetitive actions quickly. Using the CLI helps you understand what’s happening behind the scenes and gives you more control over your AWS setup, making it an essential skill for cloud work.
