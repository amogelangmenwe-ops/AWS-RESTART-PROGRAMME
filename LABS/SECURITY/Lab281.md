 LAB 281 Monitor on EC2 instances 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this lab, I explored how to monitor the performance and health of Amazon EC2 instances. The goal was to understand how to track CPU, memory, disk, and network usage, as well as how to use monitoring tools to ensure instances are running efficiently. Through hands-on exercises, I learned to set up alarms, review metrics, and interpret system performance data, which is essential for maintaining reliable and optimized cloud infrastructure.

✔ Project Objectives
-
Understand the importance of monitoring EC2 instances for performance and availability.

Learn to use monitoring tools like Amazon CloudWatch to track metrics.

Set up alarms to get notified of potential issues or performance thresholds.

Analyze key performance indicators, including CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic.

Gain practical skills in identifying performance bottlenecks and troubleshooting issues.

✔ What I Did
-
Accessed EC2 instances and checked system-level performance metrics.

Used Amazon CloudWatch to monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.

Configured alarms to notify when performance metrics exceeded predefined thresholds.

Reviewed historical metrics to identify trends and potential issues.

Learned how to interpret monitoring data to optimize instance performance and plan for scaling.

Difficulties Encountered
-
Understanding metrics: Initially, it was challenging to interpret what certain metrics meant for overall instance health.

Configuring alarms correctly: Ensuring alarms triggered only under specific conditions required careful setup.

Monitoring multiple instances: Tracking several instances simultaneously required attention to detail and organization.

Analyzing historical data: Understanding trends over time and differentiating normal spikes from issues took practice.
