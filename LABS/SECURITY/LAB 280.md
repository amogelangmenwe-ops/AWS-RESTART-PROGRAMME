                                LAB 280 FIREWALL MALAWARE 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this lab, I explored basic security concepts related to firewalls and malware protection in a computer system. The goal was to understand how firewalls control network traffic, how malware can affect systems, and how to implement basic protection strategies. Through hands-on exercises, I learned to configure firewall rules, monitor network traffic, and identify potential security threats, helping me understand the role of security in maintaining system integrity.

✔ Project Objectives
-

Understand the purpose and function of firewalls in controlling network traffic.

Learn how to create and apply firewall rules to allow or block specific connections.

Identify different types of malware and understand how they can impact a system.

Learn how to use security tools to detect and prevent malware infections.

Gain practical skills in monitoring network activity for suspicious behavior.

Understand the role of firewalls and malware protection in overall system security.

✔ What I Did
-
Explored the basics of firewall configuration using tools like ufw or iptables.

Created rules to allow or block traffic based on ports, protocols, and IP addresses.

Tested firewall rules by attempting connections and observing allowed or blocked traffic.

Learned about common types of malware and their behaviors.

Used malware detection tools to scan files and directories for threats.

Monitored system and network activity to detect suspicious behavior or potential breaches.

Difficulties Encountered
-
Understanding firewall rules syntax: Writing rules that worked as intended required attention to detail.

Testing firewall configurations: Ensuring that rules blocked or allowed the correct traffic sometimes took trial and error.

Malware identification: Understanding the signs of malware infections and distinguishing them from normal activity was challenging at first.

Balancing security and functionality: Creating rules that secured the system without blocking legitimate traffic required careful planning.
