                          LAB 263   Create Subnets and VPC 
In this lab, I learned how to design and configure a virtual network environment using Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and subnets. The main goal was to understand how to segment network resources, control IP address allocation, and manage connectivity between different parts of a network. This lab provided hands-on experience with creating VPCs, defining subnets, and understanding routing and network isolation concepts in a cloud or virtualized environment.

✔ Project Objectives
Understand the purpose of a VPC and how it isolates network resources.

Learn how to create subnets within a VPC to organize network traffic.

Assign IP address ranges to VPCs and subnets.

Explore routing between subnets and configuring access controls.

Understand the role of gateways and how they connect a VPC to the internet.

Gain practical experience with network segmentation for security and efficiency.

✔ What I Did
Created a new VPC and assigned it an IP address range.

Defined multiple subnets within the VPC for different network segments.

Configured routing tables to allow or restrict traffic between subnets.

Set up internet gateways to provide external connectivity where needed.

Verified the VPC and subnet configurations by checking IP ranges and routes.

Learned how network segmentation helps improve security and manageability.

Create Subnets 5
Difficulties Encountered
Understanding IP ranges: Calculating subnet masks and assigning correct IP ranges took careful planning. Routing configuration: Setting up routing between subnets and to the internet required understanding how traffic flows. Network isolation: Ensuring subnets were properly isolated while still allowing necessary communication was tricky at first. Multiple steps: Creating VPCs, subnets, and gateways in the right order required attention to detail.
