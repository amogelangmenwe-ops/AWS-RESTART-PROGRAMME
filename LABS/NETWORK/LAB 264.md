---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Overview
 -

In this lab, I explored how to set up and manage networking resources within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The focus was on understanding components like route tables, internet gateways, NAT gateways, and security groups, and how they work together to control traffic flow, connectivity, and security. The lab provided hands-on experience with configuring networking resources to create a functional, secure, and scalable cloud network environment.

✔ Project Objectives
-

Understand the purpose of networking resources in a VPC.

Learn how to attach and configure internet gateways to allow external access.

Explore route tables to control how traffic moves between subnets and the internet.

Understand NAT gateways for allowing outbound internet traffic from private subnets.

Learn about security groups and network ACLs to manage inbound and outbound traffic.

Gain practical skills in configuring VPC components to ensure connectivity and security.

✔ What I Did
-

Created and attached an internet gateway to the VPC for external connectivity.

Configured route tables to manage traffic flow between subnets and to the internet.

Set up NAT gateways to allow private subnets to access the internet securely.

Created and applied security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.

Verified network configurations by testing connectivity between subnets and to external resources.

Learned how combining these resources ensures a secure, well-structured network.

Difficulties Encountered
-
Understanding traffic flow: It was initially challenging to visualize how packets move between subnets, gateways, and the internet.

Configuring route tables correctly: Assigning routes to the right subnets and gateways required careful planning.

Security rules: Writing security group rules that were secure yet functional took careful attention.

Multiple interdependent resources: Ensuring internet gateways, NAT gateways, and route tables all worked together correctly was tricky at first.
