                                LAB 280 FIREWALL MALAWARE 

In this lab, I explored basic security concepts related to firewalls and malware protection in a computer system. The goal was to understand how firewalls control network traffic, how malware can affect systems, and how to implement basic protection strategies. Through hands-on exercises, I learned to configure firewall rules, monitor network traffic, and identify potential security threats, helping me understand the role of security in maintaining system integrity.

✔ Project Objectives

Understand the purpose and function of firewalls in controlling network traffic.

Learn how to create and apply firewall rules to allow or block specific connections.

Identify different types of malware and understand how they can impact a system.

Learn how to use security tools to detect and prevent malware infections.

Gain practical skills in monitoring network activity for suspicious behavior.

Understand the role of firewalls and malware protection in overall system security.

✔ What I Did

Explored the basics of firewall configuration using tools like ufw or iptables.

Created rules to allow or block traffic based on ports, protocols, and IP addresses.

Tested firewall rules by attempting connections and observing allowed or blocked traffic.

Learned about common types of malware and their behaviors.

Used malware detection tools to scan files and directories for threats.

Monitored system and network activity to detect suspicious behavior or potential breaches.

Difficulties Encountered

Understanding firewall rules syntax: Writing rules that worked as intended required attention to detail.

Testing firewall configurations: Ensuring that rules blocked or allowed the correct traffic sometimes took trial and error.

Malware identification: Understanding the signs of malware infections and distinguishing them from normal activity was challenging at first.

Balancing security and functionality: Creating rules that secured the system without blocking legitimate traffic required careful planning.

# 📂 Project 4.2 
                        LAB 281 Monitor on EC2 instances 

In this lab, I explored how to monitor the performance and health of Amazon EC2 instances. The goal was to understand how to track CPU, memory, disk, and network usage, as well as how to use monitoring tools to ensure instances are running efficiently. Through hands-on exercises, I learned to set up alarms, review metrics, and interpret system performance data, which is essential for maintaining reliable and optimized cloud infrastructure.

✔ Project Objectives

Understand the importance of monitoring EC2 instances for performance and availability.

Learn to use monitoring tools like Amazon CloudWatch to track metrics.

Set up alarms to get notified of potential issues or performance thresholds.

Analyze key performance indicators, including CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic.

Gain practical skills in identifying performance bottlenecks and troubleshooting issues.

✔ What I Did

Accessed EC2 instances and checked system-level performance metrics.

Used Amazon CloudWatch to monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.

Configured alarms to notify when performance metrics exceeded predefined thresholds.

Reviewed historical metrics to identify trends and potential issues.

Learned how to interpret monitoring data to optimize instance performance and plan for scaling.

Difficulties Encountered

Understanding metrics: Initially, it was challenging to interpret what certain metrics meant for overall instance health.

Configuring alarms correctly: Ensuring alarms triggered only under specific conditions required careful setup.

Monitoring multiple instances: Tracking several instances simultaneously required attention to detail and organization.

Analyzing historical data: Understanding trends over time and differentiating normal spikes from issues took practice.
